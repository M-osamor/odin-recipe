        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>A great Vitamin C and potassium boost</strong>, and only 2 
            ingredients! This is a copycat of one of my 
            favorite Robeks juices that has unfortunately
             been retired. Make sure to use freshly-squeezed 
             juice, otherwise the flavor just isn't the same
              with store-bought.</p>
              <h4>Ingredients</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>8 ounces freshly-squeezed orange juice</li>
              <li>1 medium banana, peeled and quartered</li>
            </ul>
              <h4>Steps</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Place juice and banana in blender. Blend on high until smooth and frothy. about 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
