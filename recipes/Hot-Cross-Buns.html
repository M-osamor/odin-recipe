        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A hot cross bun is a spiced sweet bun usually made with fruit, marked with a cross on the top, 
            and has been traditionally eaten on Good Friday 
            in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand,
             South Africa, Canada, India, Pakistan and the United States.
             [1] They are available all year round in some places,
              including the UK.</p>
              <p><strong>Make Dough in a Stand Mixer:</strong>
                Combine warm water and yeast in the bowl of the mixer and 
                let soften for about 5 minutes. Add flour, milk powder, 1/4
                 cup white sugar, egg, egg white, and salt. Mix, scraping the
                  dough down occasionally, on low speed using the dough hook 
                  for 10 minutes. Add butter, currants, and cinnamon and mix 
                  for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a greased 
                  bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and
                   allow it to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Proceed 
                   with the recipe instructions.</p>
